<hr/>

The main branch here is the latest updates to the Pluralsight course <b>AI-Powered React Applications: Building Intelligent Interfaces</b>. This GitHub repo includes the final code for all the modules in the course.

## Course Description

This course teaches you how to incorporate AI into your React apps to make them both more compelling to your browser users, and more valuable in general.

## Getting Started
1. **Install [Node 18.18 or later](https://nodejs.org)**.
2. **Clone this repository.** - `https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-ai-powered-react-applications` or [download the zip](https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-ai-powered-react-applications/archive/main.zip)
3. **Set your default directory to which module you want (example: `cd m2` - `cd m4`
4. **Install Node Packages with Dependencies.** - `npm install`

## Directory Structure Here

Each of the folders here represent one module of the course.  In each folder, there are subfolders that represent the completed code at the end of each clip. Where this is no clip reference, either there is no code in that clip or nothing changed from the previous clip.

Once in a clip directory, the easiest way to test the app is to first install the packages by typing at the root of that directory (in a terminal window or DOS prompt)

`npm install`

Then, do run the app you just need type

`npm run dev`

That will launch the web server on port 3000 where you can browser to it at the url: `http://localhost:3000`
