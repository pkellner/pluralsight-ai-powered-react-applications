/*
The system parameter in your code comes from the ChatGPT API design rather than specifically from the ai-sdk. It is part of OpenAI's standard format for managing conversational context with the GPT models.

Explanation:
In OpenAI's API (e.g., for GPT-4), the concept of a "system message" is introduced as part of the messages structure in a conversation. This message defines the AI's behavior and acts as an instruction set or guiding context for the rest of the interaction.

When using wrappers like ai-sdk, the system key likely maps to this functionality in OpenAI's API, where:

system: Provides overarching instructions for the AI, such as its role or specific behavioral rules.
user: Represents the user's input prompt or query.
assistant: Represents the AI's responses.
These keys help structure the conversation context and guide the AI's responses based on the provided system instructions.
